Spirograph draws animated Hypotrochoid and Epitrochoid curves.
Original program made by jugglingcats
It was written during a long stint on their jury service when they had a lot of time between sessions in court.

You can interact with the drawing by clicking on the curve to pause it. Things to try:
- Change the size of the moving circle
- Change the size of the fixed circle
- Change the pen distance from the center of the moving circle
- Resize the whole curve while keeping the shape
- Modify options using the drop down (arrow top left)

The program can also be run as a screen saver. Simply add the exe to the screen saver folder. Windows will automatically
run with the /s switch.

Most difficult part: differentiating the curve to work out the optimal angular increment to maintain a smooth
curve even when the pen speed is very high.
